# Drop Down with React + TypeScript + Vite

This project contains a simple drop-down component and is written with react and typescript.

For bundling and building the project, I used "Vite" which is a fast, light, and reliable tool for React projects.

## Features And Requirements

- [x] Using React JS
- [x] DropDown list
- [x] Select dropdown items by click
- [x] Multi select feature
- [x] Add new items by Enter
- [x] Close drop down by clicking outside of the element
- [x] Using custom hooks
- [x] Use scss for styling
- [x] Using TypeScript
- [x] Not using codes from chat bots or pre-made codes from other resources

## Commands

For installing the dependencies before running the project, please run:

```
yarn install
```

Then, for viewing the dev mode, run the following command. note that `Vite` will run the project on `localhost:4000` and automatically opens the browser.

```
yarn dev
```

For creating a production build, run the below command. The production ready files will be in `dist` folder.

```
yarn build
```

Plus, you can see production build on your local machine. Please run:

```
yarn preview
```

## Zero UI packages! (except for icons)

For this project, no UI library has been used and all the components and their logic are written by the author.

For icons, instead of using SVG files or font icons, I uses `font awesome` library to keep the project simple and clean.
